# Demoting Domain Controller

Demoting a Domain Controller (DC) involves transitioning it from a DC role to a regular member server within an Active Directory forest. This guide outlines the required setups and steps to achieve this, specifically for a forest named "soc.boy." 

### **Pre-Demotion Checklist**
- Perform a full backup of the Domain Controller, including the system state, in case rollback is necessary.
- Update the serverâ€™s preferred DNS settings to point to an active DC or DNS server in the "soc.boy" forest. Update DNS records to reflect these changes.

#### **Start the Demotion Process**

- In Server Manager:
    
    1. Click **Manage** > **Remove Roles and Features**.
        
    2. Navigate to the **Server Roles** page.
        
    3. Uncheck **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.

The wizard will detect that the server is a DC and will prompt to demote it.

Uncheck the "Active Directory Domain Services" to remove the AD functionality from the Domain Controller.

Click Remove Features.

It is safe to ignore the error message and click the "Demote this Domain Controller".

I only have one Domain Controller, so I'm selecting the second option "Last Domain". If you have two or more DC in a single domain then proceed with the first option.

Check both the options as we dont need DNS Zone and partitions. Also make sure you have proper backups.

Enter the Domain Admin credentials for the "soc.boy" domain password and click next.

#### **Restart the Server**

Once demotion is complete, the server will restart. It will no longer function as a DC but as a regular member server. Now, Try login with the local Administrator account password.

### **Post-Demotion Steps**

1. **Verify Demotion**:
    
    - Check in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) to confirm the DC is no longer listed.
        
    - Use the `nltest /dsgetdc:soc.boy` command to ensure functionality of the remaining DCs.
        
2. **Metadata Cleanup** (if manual cleanup is required):
    
    - Use `ntdsutil` to remove lingering metadata of the demoted DC.
        
    - Run the following commands:
        
        ```
        ntdsutil
        metadata cleanup
        select operation target
        list domains
        select domain <domain_name>
        list sites
        select site <site_name>
        remove selected server
        ```
        
3. **Reconfigure Server**:
    
    - Remove any remnants of Active Directory configurations.
        
    - Reassign server roles if necessary (e.g., file sharing, application hosting).
