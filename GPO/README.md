# What are GPO?

**GPO (Group Policy Object)** is like a set of rules or instructions that a company can use to manage how computers and users behave in a network. Imagine your office has rules like "Everyone must wear ID badges" or "The office doors lock automatically at 6 PM." A GPO does something similar, but for computers and users.

Here are a few examples of what GPO can do:

- **Enforce Password Policies**: It can require users to have strong passwords and change them regularly.
- **Control Software Installation**: It can prevent users from installing unauthorized programs on their computers.
- **Set Desktop Backgrounds**: It can make sure everyone in the company has the same desktop background, like the company logo.

GPOs help IT administrators ensure that all computers in the network follow the same rules, making the network more secure and easier to manage.
